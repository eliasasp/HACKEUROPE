Threat Sight – Quantitative Cyber Risk DashboardThreat Sight is a predictive cybersecurity engine designed to shift the industry from reactive alerting to proactive threat forecasting. By applying stochastic modeling to real-time security telemetry, it anticipates attack surges before they breach critical infrastructure limits.+11. The ProblemToday’s security teams rely on reactive, rule-based systems that detect attacks only after thresholds are breached. These traditional monitors fail to quantify the underlying "threat pressure" or the mathematical probability of a future escalation.2. The SolutionWe estimate the hidden attack intensity in real time using probabilistic filtering and simulate forward escalation scenarios with Monte Carlo methods. This provides security analysts with calibrated, early-warning risk forecasts rather than just historical logs.3. The Mathematical ModelWe model the hidden attack pressure as a log-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This approach captures natural mean reversion and statistical volatility:+1$$X_{t+1}=X_{t}+\kappa(\theta-X_{t})+\sigma Z_{t}$$Attack Intensity: $\lambda_{t}=e^{X_{t}}$ Observation Model: Observed attacks follow a Poisson distribution: $Y_{t}\sim Poisson(\lambda_{t})$ Stochastic Driver: $Z_{t}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ This core model drives both our Sequential Particle Filter and our Monte Carlo forecasting engine.4. Performance & ValidationThe model was rigorously tested using two primary methods:Synthetic Regime Stress Test: Verified that the model accurately reconstructs escalation dynamics and hidden intensities under controlled "regime shifts".Out-of-Sample Backtesting: Validated against real-world data (AWS Honeypot dataset).+1MSE Reduction: 8% improvement over naive forecasting models.Reliability: 93.7% coverage for the 95% risk interval.5. Technical PipelineIngestion: Real-time security signals (logins, firewall hits, IDS logs) are processed in 10-second windows.Estimation: A Particle Filter calculates the latent "attack pressure".Simulation: Monte Carlo methods project thousands of potential future paths.Actionable Metrics: Output includes Expected Attack Volume, Worst-Case Scenarios, and the "Elevate Probability" gauge.+26. Project StructureThe repository is organized for modularity and scalability:/Backend: FastAPI server, Particle Filter logic, and Monte Carlo engine./Frontend: React-based real-time dashboard built with Lovable./Backtest: Validation scripts and performance evaluation tools.7.
